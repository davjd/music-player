05-04-17:
* Figure out the platform to use.
* Either Android studio or Qt creator.
* Figure out which platform is best.

05-05-17:
* Find the libraries that I will need
* Find out how to read audio files.
* Design the basic layout of the music player.

05-07-17:
* I've decided on Qt creator.
* Look at how to read audio files on Qt.
* Find out whether additional libraries will be needed.

---> reading audio files is possible without any additional libraries
---- but in order to get metadata, I'll need another library
---- , since Qt loads metadata only after loading the audio files.

05-08-17:
* Find out which metadata library to use
---> possible libs: Taglib, Symbian API, or just Qt's native class.
* Began creating the initial class for a 'Song'.
* Created a main file to test the audio class.
* Reading audio is simple with Qt.
* Need to start designing how classes will interact with each other.
* Began exploring TagLib.
---> Still debating whether:
---- to use Qt's metadata classes, or use TagLib.
---- TagLib seems like a better option
---- but requires more work and cmake.

05-09-17:
* I've decided to use TagLib as the library for metadata.
* I have also figured out how to link it with a simple program.
* Now I need to find out how to link it using Qt creator
-- but it should be easy!!
* Afterwards, I'll begin creating the initial classes for audio files.
* I've also decided to use Qt Media player to load the files.
* A feature that I'm planning to add later is audio visualization
-- but it doesn't seem easy so i dont know yet.
